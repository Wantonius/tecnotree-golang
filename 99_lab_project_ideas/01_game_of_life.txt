The rules for the automatons are in the Wikipedia article. The grid needs to be continuous so if the 
automaton goes over leftside it will appear on the rightside and so on. Same with up and down.

Hot tip: Use two 2d slices to represent the grid. One for the display purposes and the other for the changes
Do not make the changes to the same grid. Just do the changes to the other one and copy back to the display one.
It will a lot easier.
