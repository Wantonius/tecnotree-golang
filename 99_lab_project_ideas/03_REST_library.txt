The REST library

Implement a backend of a library app. In the library you can browse books without logging in. When you log in
you can loan books that have not been loaned and return books that you have loaned. Also there is one premade user
admin who can add,delete and edit books. So users should have isAdmin parameter which will be false for all newly registered users.

REST API

GET /books -> get all books
POST /register -> register new user. Needs username and password. Check for duplicates
POST /login -> login user. Needs username and password. Return a token
POST /api/book/:id -> loan a book with id id. Needs login and is protected by token
DELETE /api/book/:id -> return a loaned book. This can be done only by the user that loaned the book. Use Session information to store username
POST /api/admin/ -> creates a new book with the information provided by request body. You can make them similar to the ones in the link at the bottom. 
					User needs to be admin and needs to have logged in and have the token
DELETE /api/admin/:id -> delete a book. Same rules as with adding book
PUT /api/admin/:id -> edit a book. Combination of new book and delete book. Also need to be admin and have token.

Test with Insomnia or Postman or such
