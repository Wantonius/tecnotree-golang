Concurrent Blackjack 

We will create a blackjack game with a server and clients. Server will handle the 
player connections and the game logic. There will a "dealer" goroutine that plays
according to the house rules (take another card at 16 and stay at 17). Use only
one deck. Connections are mostly handled like in the chat app example except for the
game logic. Connect to the clients with sockets and synchronize with channels in the server. 

Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack

Do not implement splitting or insurance. Start by implementing the connections and dealing first two cards.

Also aces can be only 11 in this case.
