The Goroutine Socket Restaurant

Based on the chat app we will create a restaurant. When clients contact
the restaurant they are given a table. Clients can send their orders
in like messages in the chat app. However these are not sent to everybody
but rather there is a single kitchen goroutine which gets ALL the messages
coming from clients. This will replace the individual send() goroutines for clients.
It will only print out the orders. The startService is obviously still there

Bonus 1, if you have time:
Add a menu which is sent from the server to the clients when the connection is first opened.
