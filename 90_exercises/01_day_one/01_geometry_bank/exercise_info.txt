Geometry Bank

We will create a bank to store, view and remove rectangles and circles. Rectangle is a struct type containing width and height.
Circle is also a struct type containing radius. We will also create an interface called geometry which both structs will
implement. Interface will have area() and perim() functions which return the area and the perimeter of said geometry.

We will also create a slice to store circles and another to store rectangles. There will be a app loop that prompts the user to do one of the following actions:

1. Add new rectangle to the store
2. Add new circle to the store
3. Display all rectangles
4. Display all circles
5. Remove a rectangle by index
6. Remove a circle by index
7. Quit

Use the interface when you display the information. Range through with for and call for a measurement function.

Use fmt.Scanf() function for the user input when creating new rectangles and circles, when deleting existing ones and accessing the app loop
